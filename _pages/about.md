<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Geography at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, [Spatial Computing and Data Mining Lab](https://scdm.geography.wisc.edu/). My research interests lie in remote sensing, precision agriculture, natural hazards, and deep learning. I focus on integrating advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques with traditional remote sensing applications.


My current work involves:
- **Wildfire burnt area mapping** using bi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery and attention-based U-Net models  
- **Hydrological streamflow prediction** with graph neural networks  
- **Precision agriculture monitoring** using deep spectral reconstruction methods from multispectral inputs

In the future, I aim to continue exploring cutting-edge methods for spatiotemporal change detection and disaster monitoring.
